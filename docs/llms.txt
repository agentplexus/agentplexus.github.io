# About
AgentPlexus is a collection of open source Go modules for building AI agent applications.
We provide composable infrastructure that lets developers build AI agents without vendor lock-in.

# Core Modules

## OmniLLM
Multi-provider LLM abstraction layer. Unified interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, and Ollama.
Supports streaming, tool calling, and observability hooks.
GitHub: https://github.com/agentplexus/omnillm

## OmniVault
Multi-provider secret management. Use environment variables, OS keyring, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets with the same API.

## OmniSerp
Multi-provider search abstraction. Query Serper.dev, SerpAPI, or other search backends with a consistent interface.
Supports web, news, images, and video search.
GitHub: https://github.com/agentplexus/omniserp

## OmniObserve
Multi-provider LLM observability. Send traces to Opik, Langfuse, or Arize Phoenix without vendor lock-in.
Includes AgentOps semantic conventions for multi-agent systems.
GitHub: https://github.com/agentplexus/omniobserve

## OmniVoice
Multi-provider voice and audio. Text-to-speech via ElevenLabs, phone calls via Twilio.
More providers coming soon.

## Posture
Cross-platform security assessment. Check TPM, Secure Boot, disk encryption, and biometrics on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
GitHub: https://github.com/agentplexus/posture

## VaultGuard
Security-gated credentials. Combines Posture security checks with OmniVault secret management.

## AgentKit
Reusable agent components. Base agent patterns, LLM factory, Eino orchestration utilities, and Helm chart templates.

# Key Concepts
- All modules are written in Go
- Each module focuses on one concern
- Modules are composable and work together
- No vendor lock-in - swap providers without code changes
- Open source under permissive licenses

# Examples
- stats-agent-team: Multi-agent statistics verification using OmniLLM, OmniSerp, OmniObserve
- go-comet-ml-opik: Go SDK for Opik observability, built with Claude Opus 4.5
- go-elevenlabs: Go SDK for ElevenLabs audio platform
